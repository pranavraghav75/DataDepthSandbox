"""
DeepVisualization Function - Visual Insights from Neural Network Models

Significance:
DeepVisualization focuses on generating visual insights directly from neural network models. 
By visualizing latent spaces, feature activations, and decision boundaries, this function helps 
users understand how deep learning models process data and make predictions.

Planned Functionality:
- Visualize latent spaces from neural network embeddings.
- Plot feature activations and filters in CNNs.
- Show decision boundaries learned by deep models.
- Create interactive visualizations that update as the model trains.

Function Outline:
- visualize_latent_space(): Plots the latent space representations of data.
- show_cnn_activations(): Displays the feature activations in CNN layers.
- plot_decision_boundaries(): Visualizes decision boundaries for classification tasks.
- interactive_model_visualization(): Allows users to interact with visualizations in real-time as the model trains.
