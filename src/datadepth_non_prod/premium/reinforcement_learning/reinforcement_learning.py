ReinforcementLearning Function - Dynamic Decision-Making and Optimization

Significance:
Reinforcement learning (RL) is used within this function to optimize decision-making processes 
and improve the performance of machine learning models over time. By integrating RL, DataDepth 
can adapt to user feedback and continuously learn the best strategies for various tasks.

Planned Functionality:
- Implement reinforcement learning for dynamic algorithm selection.
- Use RL to optimize hyperparameters and model performance.
- Allow for continuous learning and adaptation based on user feedback.
- Provide visualizations of the RL training process and learned policies.

Function Outline:
- apply_reinforcement_learning(): Uses RL to dynamically select and optimize algorithms.
- optimize_with_rl(): Improves model performance using reinforcement learning techniques.
- continuous_learning_loop(): Enables the model to learn and adapt over time.
- visualize_rl_training(): Displays the progress and results of the RL training process.
