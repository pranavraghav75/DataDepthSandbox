"""
AdvancedFeatureEngineering Function - Deep Feature Extraction for Enhanced Model Performance

Significance:
This function leverages deep learning models to automatically extract complex features from 
unstructured data, such as images, text, and audio. By using pre-trained neural networks 
like CNNs for images and Transformers for text, this function helps improve the predictive 
power of machine learning models by providing rich, high-dimensional feature sets.

Planned Functionality:
- Extract features from images using CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- Use Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT) to extract contextual embeddings from text.
- Allow integration of custom models for specific data types.
- Provide options for fine-tuning pre-trained models on user-specific data.

Function Outline:
- extract_image_features(): Uses CNNs to extract features from image data.
- extract_text_features(): Leverages Transformers to generate embeddings for text data.
- fine_tune_model(): Allows users to fine-tune pre-trained models on their own datasets.
- integrate_custom_model(): Supports the integration of user-defined models for feature extraction.
