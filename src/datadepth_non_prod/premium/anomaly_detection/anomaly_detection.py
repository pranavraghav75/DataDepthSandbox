"""
AnomalyDetection Function - Deep Learning for Detecting Outliers and Anomalies

Significance:
This function uses deep learning models such as Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), 
and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect anomalies in datasets. Anomaly detection 
is crucial in identifying rare or unusual events that may indicate problems or opportunities 
within the data.

Planned Functionality:
- Detect anomalies using Autoencoders and VAEs.
- Generate synthetic data for anomaly detection with GANs.
- Visualize anomalies and their impact on the dataset.
- Provide customizable thresholds for defining anomalies.

Function Outline:
- detect_anomalies_autoencoder(): Identifies anomalies using Autoencoders.
- generate_synthetic_anomalies(): Uses GANs to create synthetic data for testing anomaly detection.
- visualize_anomalies(): Plots anomalies and their significance within the data.
- set_anomaly_thresholds(): Allows users to define what constitutes an anomaly in their data.
