"""
AutomatedModelBuilding Function - Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Optimal Model Selection

Significance:
This function automates the process of selecting and optimizing neural network architectures 
for a given dataset. By leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), users can automatically 
identify the best-performing models without needing to manually experiment with different 
architectures. This is particularly useful for deep learning tasks where architecture choice 
is critical.

Planned Functionality:
- Automate the search for optimal neural network architectures.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning using deep learning methods.
- Support for a wide range of neural network types (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).
- Provide visualizations of the architecture search process.

Function Outline:
- search_optimal_architecture(): Uses NAS to explore and select the best neural network architecture.
- tune_hyperparameters(): Applies deep learning techniques to optimize model parameters.
- visualize_search_process(): Provides visual insights into the architecture search.
- apply_best_model(): Automatically applies the best-found model to the dataset.
