"""
TimeSeriesForecasting Function - Deep Learning Models for Predictive Time-Series Analysis

Significance:
This function provides advanced time-series forecasting capabilities using deep learning 
models such as LSTMs, GRUs, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). These models are 
particularly effective for capturing temporal dependencies and making accurate predictions 
based on historical data.

Planned Functionality:
- Implement LSTM, GRU, and TCN models for time-series forecasting.
- Allow for ensemble modeling to improve forecasting accuracy.
- Provide tools for handling missing data and seasonality in time-series.
- Support for visualizing forecasted results and model performance.

Function Outline:
- train_time_series_model(): Trains a deep learning model on time-series data.
- ensemble_forecasts(): Combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
- handle_missing_data(): Deals with gaps and irregularities in time-series data.
- visualize_forecasts(): Plots forecasted data and model performance metrics.
