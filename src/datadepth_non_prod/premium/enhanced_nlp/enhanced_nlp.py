"""
EnhancedNLP Function - Deep Learning for Advanced Natural Language Processing

Significance:
EnhancedNLP extends the capabilities of basic NLP tasks by integrating deep learning models 
such as BERT, GPT, and T5. These models enable advanced text processing tasks, including text 
generation, summarization, and sentiment analysis, allowing users to derive deeper insights 
from textual data.

Planned Functionality:
- Use BERT for contextual embeddings and sentiment analysis.
- Implement GPT for text generation and summarization.
- Provide options for fine-tuning NLP models on domain-specific text.
- Support entity recognition and relationship mapping using Transformers.

Function Outline:
- apply_contextual_embeddings(): Generates text embeddings using BERT.
- generate_text_summary(): Summarizes text using GPT or T5.
- fine_tune_nlp_model(): Allows users to fine-tune NLP models for specific tasks.
- recognize_entities(): Identifies entities and relationships in text data.
