ImageDataProcessing Function - Deep Learning for Image Classification and Analysis

Significance:
This function leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and analyze image data. 
It can be used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and feature extraction, 
providing a powerful tool for users working with visual data.

Planned Functionality:
- Implement image classification using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- Support object detection with models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN.
- Extract deep features from images for use in other machine learning models.
- Provide visualization tools for analyzing CNN outputs.

Function Outline:
- classify_images(): Classifies images using a CNN model.
- detect_objects(): Identifies and labels objects within images.
- extract_image_features(): Generates features from images for further analysis.
- visualize_cnn_layers(): Visualizes the activations and filters of CNN layers.
