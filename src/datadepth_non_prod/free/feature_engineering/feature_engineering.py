"""
FeatureEngineering Function - Enhancing Model Performance

Significance:
FeatureEngineering is key to improving model performance by creating new features 
from existing data. This function automates feature selection, interaction feature 
generation, and the creation of temporal features for time-series data. It provides 
the tools needed to extract the most predictive information from raw data.

Planned Functionality:
- Automated feature selection.
- Generation of interaction and polynomial features.
- Temporal feature creation for time-series data.
- Handling high-cardinality features.

Function Outline:
- select_features(): Automatically selects the most relevant features.
- generate_interaction_features(): Creates new features by combining existing ones.
- create_temporal_features(): Generates features based on time-series data.
- handle_high_cardinality(): Manages categorical features with many unique values.
