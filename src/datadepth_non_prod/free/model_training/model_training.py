"""
ModelTraining Function - Building and Evaluating Models

Significance:
ModelTraining provides the tools to train machine learning models with minimal effort.
It includes automated model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation, 
ensuring that users can build robust models without needing extensive expertise in 
machine learning.

Planned Functionality:
- Built-in support for common algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.
- Cross-validation and model evaluation metrics.
- Automated model comparison.

Function Outline:
- train_model(): Trains a model based on user-selected algorithms and data.
- tune_hyperparameters(): Automatically optimizes model parameters.
- evaluate_model(): Provides performance metrics for trained models.
- compare_models(): Compares multiple models to determine the best one.
