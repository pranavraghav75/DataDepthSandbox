"""
DataTransformation Function - Structuring and Optimizing Data

Significance:
The DataTransformation function restructures raw data into formats that are optimized 
for analysis and machine learning. It supports encoding categorical variables, scaling 
features, and reducing dimensionality, among other tasks. This function ensures that 
data is in the best possible shape for downstream processing.

Planned Functionality:
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling (normalization, standardization).
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
- Data aggregation and pivoting.

Function Outline:
- encode_categorical(): Transforms categorical data into numerical representations.
- scale_features(): Applies scaling techniques to normalize or standardize data.
- reduce_dimensions(): Reduces data dimensionality to improve model performance.
- aggregate_data(): Aggregates data to provide higher-level insights.
