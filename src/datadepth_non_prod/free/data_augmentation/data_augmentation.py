"""
DataAugmentation Function - Expanding and Balancing Datasets

Significance:
DataAugmentation is critical for enhancing small or imbalanced datasets by generating 
synthetic data points or augmenting existing data. This function is particularly 
valuable in scenarios where data is scarce or biased, allowing for more robust 
and generalizable models.

Planned Functionality:
- Text data augmentation (synonym replacement, random insertion).
- Image data augmentation (flipping, rotating, cropping).
- Oversampling and undersampling to balance classes.
- Generating synthetic tabular data.

Function Outline:
- augment_text(): Applies augmentation techniques to textual data.
- augment_image(): Augments image data with transformations.
- balance_data(): Balances datasets using over- or undersampling techniques.
- generate_synthetic_data(): Creates synthetic data to expand small datasets.
