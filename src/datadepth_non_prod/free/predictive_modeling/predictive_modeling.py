PredictiveModeling Function - Making Data-Driven Predictions

Significance:
PredictiveModeling allows users to build and deploy predictive models quickly and 
effectively. Whether it's classification, regression, or time-series forecasting, 
this function supports a wide range of predictive tasks and provides insights 
into the likely outcomes based on historical data.

Planned Functionality:
- Pre-built pipelines for common predictive tasks.
- Support for time-series forecasting.
- Feature importance analysis.
- Probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimation.

Function Outline:
- predict_outcome(): Uses trained models to make predictions on new data.
- forecast_time_series(): Provides time-series forecasts based on historical data.
- analyze_feature_importance(): Shows which features contribute most to the predictions.
- estimate_uncertainty(): Estimates uncertainty in predictions and models.
